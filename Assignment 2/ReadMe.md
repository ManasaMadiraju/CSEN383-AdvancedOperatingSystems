To execute the code, navigate to the directory in the terminal and follow these steps:

1. Compile the code using the command:
   ```
   gcc -o main *.c
   ```

2. Run the compiled program by typing:
   ```
   ./main
   ```

To save the output to a file, run the binary file as follows:
   ```
   ./main >output.exe
   ```

This will save the output of the program to a file named "output.exe".
